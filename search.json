In this project, we analysed the weight, accelerated speed, displacement, shape of engine, and many other properties of these two types of cars.Generally speaking, automatic cars are heavier than manual cars, can achieve higher accelerated speed and have greater displacement. Lighter cars can achieve higher accelerated speed than heavier cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions Used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr: select, rename, arrange, filter, group_by\nggplot2: geom_bar, geom_point, geom_line\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“Callout Blocks.” n.d.
