By describing and analyzing features of cars to distinguish the proporties of automatic and manual cars.

-   The intended audience are car sellers, car managers, drivers, and those who want to gain more general knowledge about automatic and manual cars.

-   The dataset [mtcars](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars)  was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models). [@facebook]

## Data Analysis
:::

First, we count the number of automatic and manual cars in the dataset.

```{r}
am_class <- data.frame(data$am)
am_class <- rename(am_class, am = data.am)

ggplot(data=am_class, mapping=aes(x=am)) +
  geom_bar(stat="count",width=0.5, fill="#666666") +
  xlab("car type") + ylab("count") +
  labs(title = "Bar Plot of Number of Two Types of Cars",
              subtitle = "Count the number of automatic cars and manual cars seperately",
              caption = "Jiaqi Cheng") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Let's have a look of the mean of important variables of these two types of cars.

```{r}
data_gb_am <- group_by(data, am)
summarise(data_gb_am, miles_per_gallon = mean(mpg, na.rm=TRUE), displacement = mean(disp, na.rm = TRUE), horsepower = mean(hp, na.rm = TRUE), weight = mean(wt, na.rm = TRUE), mile_time = mean(qsec, na.rm=TRUE))
```

- Then we evaluate the accelerated speed of two types of cars.

```{r}
qsec_ordered <- arrange(data, qsec)

ggplot(qsec_ordered, aes(weight, qsec, fill = shape_of_engine, size = displacement)) +
  geom_point(shape=21,colour="black",stroke=0.25,alpha=0.8) + 
  facet_grid(.~am) +
  xlab("weight (1000 lbs)") + ylab("accelerated speed (1/4 mile time)") +
  labs(title = "Numeric Proporties of Automatic and Manual Cars",
              subtitle = "Compare weight, accelerated speed, displacement, shape of engine of two types of cars",
              caption = "Jiaqi Cheng") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

-   Furthermore, we explore the connection between the weight and accelerated speed of automatic cars.

```{r}
auto_v <- filter(data, am == "automatic")
df <- data.frame(auto_v$weight, auto_v$qsec)

ggplot()+geom_line(data = df,aes(x = auto_v.weight,y = auto_v.qsec),size=1)+
  geom_point(data = df,aes(x = auto_v.weight,y = auto_v.qsec),size=3)+
  xlab("weight")+ylab("accelerated speed")+
  labs(title = "Line Chart of Weight and Accelerated Speed of Automatic Cars",
              subtitle = "Compare the accelerated speed of automatic cars of different weight",
              caption = "Jiaqi Cheng") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Summary
:::

Automatic cars and manual cars have different features. In this project, we analysed the weight, accelerated speed, displacement, shape of engine, and many other properties of these two types of cars.Generally speaking, automatic cars are heavier than manual cars, can achieve higher accelerated speed and have greater displacement. Lighter cars can achieve higher accelerated speed than heavier cars.
